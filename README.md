# Netflix-Clone
This website was developed as solution to a challenge for an Internship application.
I used HTML/CSS and a bit of Javascript for some functionality.
The website is responsive to all screen sizes.
I used "media-query" to make it responsive.
I used CSS Flexbox primarily for the layout of the website.
